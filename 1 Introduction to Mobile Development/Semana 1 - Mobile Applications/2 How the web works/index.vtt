1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Technology continues to expand

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.660
into wide range of devices.

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.700
As you go about
your daily routine,

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.070
you've possibly interacted
with technology on

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.140
many devices from mobiles to

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.735
wearables, or even
refrigerators.

7
00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:14.490
Partly because of the increase

8
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.870
in these different devices,

9
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.280
the demand for web and

10
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.270
mobile developers is high
and continues to grow.

11
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.310
That growth makes cross-platform
programming skills

12
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.590
invaluable to any developer.

13
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.750
Cross-platform developers make

14
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.850
software applications
that are compatible with

15
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.760
multiple operating systems and

16
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.810
there's currently a shortage

17
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.210
of specialized
application developers.

18
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.910
A specialized
developer focuses on

19
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.155
a particular domain with
great in-depth knowledge.

20
00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:45.340
That type of demand means
that upskilling yourself in

21
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.635
a cross-platform
application development

22
00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:49.475
could be a smart move.

23
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.120
The skills you gain with
a course like this can

24
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.729
lead to many opportunities
for employment.

25
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.505
Both newcomers and
season developers

26
00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.640
can find job opportunities
in the current market.

27
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.380
In this video, you'll learn more

28
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.940
about the roles associated with

29
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.300
a skilled cross-platform
application developer and

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.500
the typical skills and tasks
associated with such jobs.

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.400
What kind of things does a
cross-platform developer do?

32
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.440
Well, job descriptions can vary

33
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.225
greatly depending on the
position advertised.

34
00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.840
Each company, and
even each project

35
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.975
may require a
different approach.

36
00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:28.160
Some of the common tasks and
responsibilities shared by

37
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.280
cross-platform developers
include: writing code,

38
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.780
always a prime requirement of

39
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.660
a developer and it's especially
important to have clean,

40
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.165
readable, and error-free code
when the aim is to create

41
00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.080
apps compatible with
several operating systems.

42
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.850
Dealing with bugs.
Another tanks human issue

43
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.155
that typically occurs

44
00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:46.820
involves finding and fixing

45
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.675
bugs and attending to
performance issues.

46
00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.550
Development of new
app features and new

47
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.295
UI or user interfaces
for the app.

48
00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:58.915
Often this can entail
upgrading existing code.

49
00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:02.400
Application monitoring
to identify problems.

50
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.965
You might do this by observing

51
00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.635
app performance or
analyzing data.

52
00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.050
Developers are also
involved in building

53
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.350
clean and smooth animations
and transitions.

54
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.140
These are design techniques
that help to provide

55
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.265
an excellent UX or
user experience.

56
00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:20.735
Other common
cross-platform tasks

57
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:23.750
include integrating
third-party technologies,

58
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.735
like application
program interfaces or

59
00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:30.980
APIs to connect the app with
other technologies or code,

60
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.725
writing tests, and
releasing applications,

61
00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.330
and updates to the Apple
and Google stores.

62
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.140
That's a brief overview
of some common tasks and

63
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.820
responsibilities
you're likely to

64
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.555
find in a cross-platform
developer role.

65
00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:46.460
Many of those tasks
involve coding.

66
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.590
What programming languages

67
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.975
do cross-platform
developers need?

68
00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.270
Well, the language
required often

69
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.475
depends on the project
or the company,

70
00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.365
but language choice is primarily
guided by the framework.

71
00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:01.640
A framework is a
platform that provides

72
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.020
the foundation and tools

73
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.420
to develop software
applications.

74
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.700
It's sometimes
compared to a template

75
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.375
that you modify it by
adding your own code.

76
00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.080
The most important now,

77
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.430
which for you to know is the one

78
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.050
that the framework is based on.

79
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.580
Just three are mentioned here,

80
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.785
but many other frameworks
are available.

81
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.665
For instance, the
React Native framework

82
00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:23.170
uses JavaScript,

83
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.255
Flutter uses Google's
programming language Dart,

84
00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:27.860
and Xamarin is built using

85
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.120
the C-Sharp
programming language.

86
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.470
Apart from the language
associated with the framework,

87
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.150
a development language may be

88
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.310
related to particular platforms.

89
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.320
For instance, Android developers

90
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.705
use languages such
as Java and Kotlin,

91
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:45.520
while iOS developers use
Objective-C and Swift.

92
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.470
Then many development
tasks will involve using

93
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.755
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

94
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:54.925
These are used to build
websites or applications.

95
00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:58.070
While not considered to be
actual programming languages,

96
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.780
learning these can
expand your choice

97
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.195
of job roles and projects.

98
00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:04.730
I think I've covered that
it's great if you know

99
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.190
a language and its
associated framework.

100
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.830
For example, if you
learn JavaScript,

101
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.270
you're then ready to explore

102
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.465
cross-platform development
with React Native.

103
00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:17.255
I've also emphasized
that it's a bonus

104
00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.790
if you've proficiency
in other languages.

105
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.980
Furthermore, I'd
consider it wise for

106
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.350
cross-platform developers
to at least be

107
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.320
aware of some related
skills and concepts.

108
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.360
That includes being
knowledgeable about

109
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.545
standard web development,
the browser,

110
00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:34.850
and third party integrations
like REST APIs,

111
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.090
which help you to interact
with RESTful web services,

112
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.060
such as getting weather
or geolocation data.

113
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.340
Apart from the many
coding skills,

114
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.200
developers often work as part of

115
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.840
a team which can include
other developers,

116
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.860
project managers, QA
professionals, and designers.

117
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.190
Knowing how to use tools
like Slack for chat,

118
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.585
Zoom for video calls,

119
00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:59.030
and Jira for support
tickets makes it

120
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.410
easier for you to integrate

121
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.285
and stay connected to the team.

122
00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:05.450
Your role may involve
helping to plan projects and

123
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.580
participating in the
project progression

124
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.580
by attending Team meetings.

125
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.510
In addition, you'll find that

126
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.130
almost all developers spend

127
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.515
some time researching
their projects,

128
00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:16.940
watching emerging trends,

129
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.530
and keeping up-to-date with

130
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.480
the language and
platform changes.

131
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.140
Let's say that you've mastered

132
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.530
your cross-platform
development skills.

133
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.900
Now, where in the job
market do you find work?

134
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.590
Because cross-platform
development skills are in demand,

135
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.360
there are many
roles available for

136
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.505
web and mobile developers.

137
00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.174
Let's explore the job options.

138
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.410
Cross-platform
development is popular

139
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.730
with small companies and

140
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.650
startups who understand how
apps can aid their growth,

141
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.390
and is equally useful
to large companies.

142
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.890
For instance, they may want

143
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.360
to build apps that
help them gain

144
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.460
a slight competitive
advantage or

145
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.015
foster engagement
with their user base.

146
00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:01.115
Contracting development
agencies often use

147
00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:04.010
cross-platform development
as it helps them to quickly

148
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.555
use existing talent and
offer more services.

149
00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:09.904
There's a high demand
for developers,

150
00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:11.150
but perhaps you are not

151
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.265
attracted by any
of the job offers.

152
00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:16.040
Well, having cross-platform
development skills

153
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.300
means that you can work as

154
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.250
a freelance web app developer

155
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.625
or start your own
development company.

156
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.470
From specialists to general
software engineers,

157
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.495
cross-platform
development is used

158
00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:28.970
widely and is in
very high demand.

159
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.935
As a result, it's an
invaluable skill set to have.

160
00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:33.950
You should now have a
better understanding

161
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.930
of a cross-platform
developer's role,

162
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.540
their responsibilities,
and the skills they need.
